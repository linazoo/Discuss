  CMV is a subreddit dedicated to the civil discourse of opinions, and is built around the idea that in order to resolve our differences, we must first understand them. We believe that productive conversation requires respect and openness, and that certitude is the enemy of understanding.

  That's why CMV is the perfect place to post an opinion you're open to changing. We're not looking to host aggressive debates, or encourage judgement, but help each other understand different perspectives.
